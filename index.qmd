## About Me

I'm a student at Brigham Young University pursuing dual degrees in Strategic Management and Statistics (Data Analytics). My work focuses on the intersection of finance, technology, and entrepreneurship—leveraging data-driven insights and AI to transform investment decision-making.

Currently serving as an Investment Analyst at Nucleus Fund, I bring experience in commercial banking, financial modeling, and AI integration. I'm passionate about Venture Capital, Private Equity, and fund structuring.
